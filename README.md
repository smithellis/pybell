pybell
======

pybell checks to see if a device has joined the network (assuming you have assigned it a static address) and then performs some action.

The idea is this is a "doorbell" that allows your server to know that you are home; the next steps will be to interface with home automation (or email, or whatever) to perform some actions.

======

Usage would require you set up a cron at whatever intervals you'd like to perform the check.
