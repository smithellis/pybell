pybell
======

pybell checks to see if your phone has joined the network (assuming you have assigned it a static address) and then performs some action.

The idea is this is a "doorbell" that tells your system that you are home; the next steps will be to interface with home automation to perform some actions.

Hey, I'm learning python...so keep the bar low right now guys.
